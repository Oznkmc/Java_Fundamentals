## IF-ELSE Structure

`if-else` is a decision-making mechanism. When we need to perform different actions based on conditions ‚Äî such as "if" something is true or "else" if it is not ‚Äî we use the `if-else` structure.

1. **`if`**: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.  
2. **`else`**: Executes a block of code if the condition is false.  
3. **`else if`**: Used when checking multiple conditions.

## SWITCH-CASE Structure

The `switch-case` structure is used to perform actions based on multiple possible values of a variable.  
It provides a cleaner and more readable alternative to using multiple `if-else` conditions.  
The `switch` structure allows you to check one expression against several possible cases.

1. **`switch`**: The expression or value to be evaluated is written here.  
2. **`case`**: A block of code is executed if the value matches this case.  
3. **`default`**: A block of code is executed if no case matches.

## üîÅ Loops

Loops allow repeated execution of code blocks based on conditions or counts. Java offers four main types:

### 1. `for` Loop  
Used when the number of iterations is known. Consists of initialization, condition, and update expressions. Executes the loop body while the condition is true.

### 2. `while` Loop  
Executes the loop body repeatedly **while** the condition is true. Condition is checked before each iteration. Suitable when iteration count is unknown.

### 3. `do-while` Loop  
Similar to `while` but guarantees the loop body runs at least once. Condition is checked **after** executing the loop body.

### 4. `for-each` Loop  
Simplified loop for iterating over arrays or collections. Automatically traverses each element without using an index.
